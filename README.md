I'm J.R.  I have a BA in Political Science, but I've since discovered that it's not particularly marketable, which is why I'm currently a
student at WGU studying software developement with an expected graduation date of May, 2024.  I have taken courses on Java and C++, and
studied Python in my spare time.
Thank you for reading.
